### Rabbit R1
Cool little device, finicky and the Agentic AI part is in the cloud so you have no real control of it.

### EvenRealities G1B Smart Glasses


 In USD for the basic glasses about $600,  $300 Clips, about $1200 for prescription glasses.
My opinion is I don't wear the glasses all day, if I did wear contact lens I would just have got the regular glasses and put them away 
when I didn't need them. I got the full prescription set.

They are really interesting. If giving a presentation I would have backups of everything I want to present.

I did a full review here: https://github.com/hpssjellis/my-examples-and-posts-of-g1-even-realities-smart-glasses  <br>

The cell phone app is efficient and shows the main abilities of:
1. Quicknote(hold right temple: speak, records in the app),
2. Translate(Only one that Pay monthly: Translates while someone talks to your screen),
3. Navigate(Big and little maps visible on the glasses),
4. Teleprompt(The reason to purchase, full speeches on theglasses timed or auto listen),
5. Even AI(Hold left temple, ask the AI, read the reply, amaing in the classroom),
6. Transcribe (You speak it transcribes then the AI can tidy it up. Hack: have a few blank so you can type to the AI),
7. Dashboard (Look up to get the Time Date, messages and news. The news feature is amazing when boared),
