### EvenRealities G1B Smart Glasses


 In USD for the basic glasses about $600,  $300 Clips, about $1200 for prescription glasses.
My op[inion is I don't wear the glasses all day, if I did wear contact lens I would just have got the regular glasses and put them away 
when I didn't need them. 

They are really interesting. If giving a presentation I would have backups of everything I want to present.
